    "# Chapter 1 the basics of bayesian statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian statistics mostly involves <b>conditional probability</b>, which is the probability of an event A <b>given</b> event B, and it can be calculated using the bayes rule. The concept of conditional probability is widely used in medical testing, in which false positives and false negatives may occur. A false positive can be defined as a positive outcome on a medical test when the patient does not actually have the disease they are being tested for. In other words, it's the probability of testing positive given no disease. Similarly, a false negative can be defined as a negative outcome on a medical test when the patient does have a disease. In other words, test negative given disease. Both indicators are critical for any medical decisions.\n",

In the early 80s, HIV had just been discovered and was rapidly expanding. There was major concern with the safety of blood supply. also, virtually no cure existed making an HIV diagnosis basically a death sentence, in addtition to the stigma that was attaches to the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "These made false positives and false negative in HIV testing highly undesirable. A <b>false positive</b> is when a test returns positive while the truth negative. That would for instance be that someone without HIV is wrongly diagnosed with HIV, wrongly ltelling that person they are going to die and casting stigma on them. A <b>False negative</b> is when a test returns negative while the truth is positive. that is when someone with HIV ondergoes an HIV test which wrongly comes back negative. the latter poses a threat to the blood supply if that person is about to donate blood.\n",

    "The probability of a false positive if the truith is negative is called the <b>False positve rate</b>.

The false positive rate of an HIV test is the probability of a positive result conditional on the person tested have no HIV.\n",
